## 1. UX/UI

### Wireframe

The game was inspired by another famous incremental game called cookie clicker, although my project still has work to become a fully fleshout game the layout is functional and provides an easily digested game experience. If you look at the images below you will find that the initial design is a bit different from the current design and the name and theme changed at the initial stages, but remain constant ever since:

### User Stories

Below you can find some of the user stories I thought off when starting to work in the game and some of the users that might be interested in playing.

**User Story 1:**
As a stressed-out college student, I want to play a clicker game during my study breaks so that I can relax and unwind for a few minutes. The simple and repetitive gameplay helps me take my mind off the complex assignments and exams, allowing me to return to my studies with renewed focus and reduced anxiety.

**User Story 2:**
As a commuter on long train rides, I want to play a clicker game on my smartphone to make my daily commutes more enjoyable. With limited internet connectivity, I can pass the time and have fun even when I'm without a stable network connection. The gradual progression and rewards keep me engaged and excited throughout my journeys.

**User Story 3:**
As a competitive individual, I want to play a clicker game that offers leaderboard functionality so that I can compete with my friends and prove my tapping skills. Participating in friendly competitions and comparing my progress with others adds an extra layer of motivation and excitement to the game. The constant drive to climb the leaderboards and outperform my peers keeps me coming back for more clicks.
